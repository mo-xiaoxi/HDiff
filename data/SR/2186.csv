"The neighbors send back ICP replies indicating a ""HIT"" or a ""MISS."""
"In current practice, ICP is implemented on top of UDP, but there is no requirement that it be limited to UDP."
A cache cannot wait longer than that before beginning to retrieve an object.
Failure to receive a reply message most likely means the network path is either congested or broken.
In either case we would not want to select that neighbor.
"As an indication of immediate network conditions between neighbor caches, ICP over a lightweight protocol such as UDP is better than one with the overhead of TCP."
Failure to receive a reply from a cache may indicate a network or system failure.
"ICP messages MUST not exceed 16,384 octets in length."
"This field should probably not be trusted over what is  provided by getpeer- name(), accept(), and recvfrom()."
In practice it is not used.
"The contents of the Payload field vary depending on the Opcode, but most often it contains a null-terminated URL string."
A place holder to detect zero-filled or malformed messages.
The payload is simply the null-terminated URL.
NOTE: the echo server will not interpret the data (i.e. we could send it anything).
"This opcode is used to tell the difference between a legitimate query or response, random garbage, and an echo response."
"ICP_OP_DECHO Similar to ICP_OP_QUERY, but for use in simulating a query to a cache which does not use ICP."
The payload is simply the null-terminated URL.
"NOTE: one problem with this approach is that while a system's echo port may be functioning perfectly, the cache software may not be running at all."
"Unless otherwise noted, the payload must be the null-terminated URL string."
ICP_OP_MISS An ICP_OP_MISS response indicates that the requested URL does not exist in this cache.
ICP_OP_ERR An ICP_OP_ERR response indicates some kind of error in parsing or handling the query message (e.g. invalid URL).
"The ICP_OP_MISS reply is an invitation to fetch the URL from the replying cache (if their relationship allows it), but ICP_OP_MISS_NOFETCH is a request to NOT fetch the URL from the replying cache."
Caches receiving a high percentage of ICP_OP_DENIED replies are probably misconfigured.
"If the percent of denied messages exceeds a certain threshold (e.g. 95% of 100 or more), the cache may choose to ignore all subsequent ICP_OP_QUERY messages from that address until some sort of administrative intervention occurs."
Many requested objects are small enough that it is possible to include them in the query response and avoid the need to make a subsequent HTTP request for the object.
CAVEAT: ICP_OP_HIT_OBJ has some negative side effects which make its use undesirable.
"Another negative side effect is that ICP_OP_HIT_OBJ messages will often be much larger than the path MTU, thereby causing fragmentation to occur on the UDP packet."
"For these reasons, use of ICP_OP_HIT_OBJ is NOT recommended."
A cache must not send an ICP_OP_HIT_OBJ unless the ICP_FLAG_HIT_OBJ flag is set in the query message Options field.
NOTE: the Object Size field does not necessarily begin on a 32-bit boundary as shown in the diagram above.
"UNRECOGNIZED OPCODES ICP messages with unrecognized or unused opcodes should be ignored, i.e. no reply generated."
"If available, the RTT value MUST be expressed as a 16-bit integer, in units of milliseconds."
"If unavailable, the responder may either set the RTT value to zero, or clear the ICP_FLAG_SRC_RTT bit in the ICP reply."
The ICP reply MUST not be delayed while waiting for the RTT measurement to occur.
"This flag is set in an ICP reply message (ICP_OP_HIT, ICP_OP_MISS, ICP_OP_MISS_NOFETCH, or ICP_OP_HIT_OBJ) to indicate that the low 16-bits of the Option Data field contain the measured RTT to the host given in the requested URL."
