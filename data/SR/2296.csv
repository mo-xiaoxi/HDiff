"Therefore, whenever a server may run a remote algorithm, it may also run a partial implementation of the algorithm, provided that the partial implementation always returns List_response when it cannot compute the real result."
The extremely low source quality value ensures that the fallback variant only gets chosen if all other options are exhausted.
"The Accept- headers contain sufficient information to make a choice on behalf of the user agent possible, and the best variant MAY be returned in a choice response."
The Accept- headers do not contain sufficient information to make a choice on behalf of the user agent possible.
"The media type quality factor is 1 if there is no type attribute in the variant description, or if there is no Accept header in the request."
"If a type is matched by none of the elements of an Accept header, the Accept header assigns the quality factor 0 to that type."
"The charset quality factor is 1 if there is no charset attribute in the variant description, or if there is no Accept-Charset header in the request."
"Otherwise, the charset quality factor is the quality assigned by the Accept-Charset header to the charset in the charset attribute."
"The language quality factor is 1 if there is no language attribute in the variant description, or if there is no Accept-Language header in the request."
"The features quality factor is 1 if there is no features attribute in the variant description, or if there is no Accept-Features header in the request."
"An overall quality value is definite if it was computed without using any wildcard characters '*' in the Accept- headers, and without the need to use the absence of a particular Accept- header."
ps.en is speculative because the type application/postscript was matched to the range */*.
"If an Accept, Accept-Charset, Accept-Language, or Accept-Features header is missing from the request, add this header with an empty field."
"Delete any wildcard '*' from the Accept-Charset, Accept-Language, and Accept-Features headers."
"The best variant, as determined by the remote variant selection algorithm, is the one variant with the highest overall quality value, or, if there are multiple variants which share the highest overall quality, the first variant in the list with this value."
"If this information is insufficient to make a choice on my behalf, do not make a choice but send the list of variants'."
"If a user agent allows the user to set the quality factors for some headers, while other factors are hard- coded, it should use a low spread on the hard-coded factors and a high spread on the user-supplied factors, so that the user settings take precedence over the built-in settings."
"As the best variant has a speculative quality value, the algorithm will not choose x.tiff, but return a list response, after which the selection algorithm of the user agent will correctly choose x.gif."
"Thus, user agents can vary the length of the Accept- headers to get an optimal tradeoff between the speed with which the first request is transmitted, and the chance that the remote algorithm has enough information to eliminate a second request."
"According to the HTTP/1.1 specification [1], the complete absence of an Accept header from the request is equivalent to the presence of `Accept: */*'."
"Thus, if the Accept header is collapsed to `Accept: */*', a user agent may omit it entirely."
"An Accept-Charset, Accept- Language, or Accept-Features header which only contains `*' may also be omitted."
"A good strategy for dynamic extension would be to extend the headers with those media types, languages, charsets, and feature tags mentioned in the variant lists of past responses from the server."
"For the next request on the same resource, and intermediate proxy cache could return a list response, which would cause the local algorithm to choose and retrieve Y instead of X.  Compared to a stable representation, a representation which randomly switches between X and Y (say, the version with and without frames) has a very low subjective quality for most users."
"As both alternatives above are unattractive, a user agent should try to avoid the above situation altogether."
"For example, if the user agent, for some reason, cannot handle the iso-8859-7 charset when rendering text/plain documents, the q_adjust factor would be 0 when the text/plain - iso-8859-7 combination is present in the variant description, and 1 otherwise."
"By selectively withholding information from the remote variant selection algorithm, the user agent can ensure that the remote algorithm will never make a choice if the local q_adjust is less than 1."
"For example, to prevent the remote algorithm from ever returning a text/plain - iso-8859-7 choice response, the user agent should take care to never produce a request which exactly specifies the quality factors of both text/plain and iso-8859-7."
"The omission of either factor from a request will cause the overall quality value of any text/plain - iso-8859-7 variant to be speculative, and variants with speculative quality values can never be returned in a choice response."
"In general, if the local q_adjust does not equal 1 for a particular combination X - Y - Z, then a remote choice can be prevented by always omitting at least one of the elements of the combination from the Accept- headers, and adding a suitable wildcard pattern to match the omitted element, if such a pattern is not already present."
