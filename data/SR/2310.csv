It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
"This document defines a HTTP response header field called Safe, which can be used to indicate that repeating a HTTP request is safe."
"Such an indication will allow user agents to handle retries of some safe requests, in particular safe POST requests, in a more user-friendly way."

when retrying a POST request which gave an indeterminate error result in the previous attempt - when the user presses the RELOAD button while a POST result is displayed - when the history function is used to redisplay a POST result which is no longer in the history buffer.
"If the POST request is unsafe, HTTP requires explicit user confirmation is before the request is repeated."
"This dialog is confusing to many users, and slows down navigation in any case."
"If the repeated POST request is safe, the user-unfriendly confirmation dialog can be omitted."
"However plain HTTP/1.1 [1] has no mechanism by which agents can tell if POST requests are safe, and they must be assumed unsafe by default."
"This document adds a mechanism to HTTP, the Safe header field, for telling if a POST request is safe."
the contents of the form are potentially very large - the form is used to upload a file (see [2]) - the application needs some internationalization features (see [3]) which are only available if the form contents are transmitted in a request body the information in the form cannot be encoded in a GET request URL because of security considerations.
"For the purpose of this specification, a HTTP request is considered to be a repetition of a previous request if both requests - are issued by the same user agent, and - apply to the same resource, and - have the same request method, and - both have no request body, or both have request bodies which are byte-wise identical after decoding of any content and transfer codings."
"If a Safe header field is absent in the response, the corresponding request MUST be considered unsafe, unless it is a GET or HEAD request."
"As GET and HEAD requests are safe by definition, user agents SHOULD ignore a `Safe: no' header field in GET and HEAD responses."
"If, according to a received Safe header field, the repeating of a request is safe, the request MAY be repeated automatically without asking for user confirmation."
The Safe header field introduces no new security risks.
The use of GET requests for form submission has some security risks which are absent for submission with other HTTP methods.
