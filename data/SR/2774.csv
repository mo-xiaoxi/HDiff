"o  Some party designs and specifies an extension; the party assigns the extension a globally unique URI, and makes one or more representations of the extension available at that address (see section 8)."
"The key words ""MUST"", ""MUST NOT"", ""REQUIRED"", ""SHALL"", ""SHALL NOT"", ""SHOULD"", ""SHOULD NOT"", ""RECOMMENDED"", ""MAY"", and ""OPTIONAL"" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6]."
This proposal does not rely on particular features defined in URLs [8] that cannot potentially be expressed using URNs (see section 8).
This specification does not define any ramifications of applying an extension to a message nor whether two extensions can or cannot logically coexist within the same message.
"An agent MUST NOT use decl- extensions to pass extension instance data, which MAY be passed using header field prefix values (see section 3.1)."
Unrecognized decl-ext parameters SHOULD be ignored and MUST NOT be removed by proxies when forwarding the extension declaration.
Header field prefixes allow an extension declaration to dynamically reserve a subspace of the header space in a protocol message in order to prevent header field name clashes and to allow multiple declarations using the same extension to be applied to the same message without conflicting.
"Linear white space (LWS) MUST NOT be used between the header-prefix and the dash (""-"") or between the prefix-match and the field-name."
Agents MUST NOT reuse header-prefix values in the same message unless explicitly allowed by the extension (see section 4.1 for a discussion of the ultimate recipient of an extension declaration).
"Note, that header-prefix consistency is no substitute for including an extension declaration in the message: header fields with header- prefix values not defined by an extension declaration in the same message are not defined by this specification."
"The extension response header fields are exclusively intended to serve as extension acknowledgements, and can not carry any other information."
The C-Ext response header field is used to indicate that all hop-by- hop mandatory extension declarations in the request were fulfilled.
"The Ext and the C-Ext header fields are not mutually exclusive; they can both occur within the same message as described in section 5.1.
doctype html ..."
"If 2) did not result in a 510 (Not Extended) status code, then process the request according to the semantics of the extensions and of the existing HTTP method name as defined in HTTP/1.1 [5] or later versions of HTTP."
"If the evaluation in 3) was successful and the mandatory request fulfilled, the server MUST respond as defined in section 5.1."
A server MUST NOT fulfill a request without understanding and obeying all mandatory extension declaration(s) in a request.
"A proxy that does not act as the ultimate recipient of a mandatory extension declaration MUST NOT remove the extension declaration or the ""M-"" method name prefix when forwarding the message (see section 5.1 for how to detect when a mandatory extension has been fulfilled)."
"A server receiving an HTTP/1.0 (or earlier versions of HTTP) message that includes a Connection header MUST, for each connection-token in this field, remove and ignore any header field(s) from the message with the same name as the connection-token."
"A server receiving a mandatory request including the ""M-"" method name prefix without any mandatory extension declarations to follow MUST return a 510 (Not Extended) response."
"The ""M-"" prefix is reserved by this proposal and MUST NOT be used by other HTTP extensions."
A server MUST NOT claim to have fulfilled any mandatory request unless it understood and obeyed all the mandatory extension declarations in the request.
This section defines a mechanism for conveying this information to the client in such a way that it interoperates with existing HTTP applications and prevents broken servers from giving the false impression that an extended request was fulfilled by responding with a 200 (Ok) response without understanding the method.
"Note, that the Ext and C-Ext header fields are not mutually exclusive; they can be both be present in a response when  fulfilling mandatory request containing both hop-by-hop as well as end-to-end mandatory extension declarations."
A server MUST NOT include mandatory extension declarations in an HTTP response unless it is responding to a mandatory HTTP request whose definition allowed for the mandatory response or the server has some a priori knowledge that the recipient can handle the extended response.
"If a client is the ultimate recipient of a mandatory HTTP response containing mandatory extension declarations that either the client does not understand or does not want to use, then it SHOULD discard the complete response as if it were a 500 (Internal Server Error) response."
The policy for accessing the resource has not been met in the request.
If the 510 response contains information about extensions that were not present in the initial request then the client MAY repeat the request if it has reason to believe it can fulfill the extension policy by modifying the request according to the information provided in the 510 response.
"While the protocol extension definition should be published at the address of the extension identifier, this specification does not require it."
"Likewise, applications are not required to attempt resolving extension identifiers included in an extension declaration."
The only absolute requirement is that an application MUST NOT claim conformance with an extension that it does not recognize (regardless of whether it has tried to resolve the extension identifier or not).
This document does not provide any policy for how long or how often an application may attempt to resolve an extension identifier.
It is strongly recommended that the integrity and persistence of the extension identifier be maintained and kept unquestioned throughout the lifetime of the extension.
Care should be taken not to distribute conflicting specifications that reference the same name.
"Even when an extension specification is made available at the address of the URI, care must be taken that the specification made available at that address does not change over time."
"If an extension does require tighter constraints on the cachebility of the response, the originator MUST include the appropriate combination of cache header fields (Cache-Control, Vary, Expires) corresponding to the required level of constraints of the extended semantics."
"The summary is intended as a guide and index to the text, but is necessarily cryptic and incomplete."
This summary should never be used or referenced separately from the complete specification.
"Origin server accepts   HTTP/1.1 200 OK the mandatory extension Ext: but ignores the         Cache-Control: max-age=120, no-cache=""Ext"" optional one."
The       ... client can not see in this case that the optional extension was ignored.
"The    Cache-Control: no-cache=""Ext"", max-age=600 response can be cached  ... by HTTP/1.1 caches for 10 minutes."
"The         C-Ext response is not         Connection: C-Ext cachable by the         Date: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT HTTP/1.0 cache but can  Expires: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GM"
"T be cached for 1 hour by Cache-Control: no-cache=""Ext"", max-age=3600 HTTP/1.1 caches."
"HTTP/1.1 200 OK the hop-by-hop          Ext: extension               Date: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT acknowledgement and     Expires: Sun, 25 Oct 1998 08:12:31 GMT forwards the remainder  Cache-Control: no-cache=""Ext"", max-age=3600 of the response."
