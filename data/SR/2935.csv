"At some point, the HTTP client at the consumer will send an HTTP request that is interpreted as an ""IOTP Startup Request"" by the Merchant HTTP server."
"Therefore, the HTTP server SHOULD avoid having its responses cached."
This can be neglected on SSL/TLS secured connections which are not cached and on HTTP POST requests in HTTP v1.1 as in v1.1 POST responses are not cached.
"Data from earlier IOTP Messages in a transaction MUST be retained by the IOTP Client so that it may (1) be copied to make up part of later IOTP messages, (2) used in calculations to verify signatures in later IOTP message, (3) be resent in some cases where a request has timed out without response, (4) used as input to the Customer Care role in later versions of IOTP, etc."
"The data MUST be retained until the end of the transaction, whether by success, failure, or cancelation, and as long thereafter as it is desired for any of the parties to inquire into it."

"is cancelled since a Cancel Block has been received, MUST stop the IOTP Transaction and hand control to the browser so that it will do a GET on the on the Cancel Net Location specified for the role from which the Cancel Block was received."
"is in error because an IOTP Message does not conform to this specification, MUST send an IOTP Message containing a Error Trading Block to role from which the erroneous message was received and the ErrorLogNetLoc specified for that role, stop the IOTP Transaction, and hand control to the browser so that it will do a GET from the Error Net Location specified for the role from which the bad message was received."
