Setup for windows server 2019. 

1. Open manage menu then click "Add Roles and Features"
2. Turn on Windows features: Internet Information Service and  ASP.NET 4.5
3. Wait for installation complete.
3. Copy index.aspx and web.config into your web root directory.

It would better do as [Enable Aspx on IIS](https://techexpert.tips/iis/enabling-aspx-iis/) says.
